Generates a similarity network for a book based on tags queried from Open Library's Search API

As someone who is quite picky about what they read, searching for my next book can often be a time consuming task. 
My goal with this project was to help myself and others narrow in on specific aspects of books they enjoy, and find reads that share in that aspect. 

For example, if you just read Girl with a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier, and found that having a main character who is an artist is a fascinating perspective, the application will query a tag for books about artists, and generate corresponding recommendations.

Currently working on improving output and functionality. As of now, it is about 70% complete.
